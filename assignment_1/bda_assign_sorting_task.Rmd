## Sorting Task

This R-script will sort the outputs (lowercase words and numbers) by count from our MR-jobs in Hadoop.
I will first give an example on how to read in a txt file into a dataframe or tibble, sort the given data by the "count" column and finally saving them again in a text file. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

numbers <- read.table("example-sort.txt")
  
words <- read.table("example-sort-words.txt")

numbers_df <- tidyr::separate(numbers, col = 1, into = "key" , sep = " ⁠")

words_df <- tidyr::separate(words, col = 1, into = "key", sep = " ")

arrange(numbers_df, desc(V2)) -> numbers_srtd

arrange(words_df, desc(V2)) -> words_srtd

#arrange(words_db, -desc("V2"))

numbers_srtd

words_srtd

write.csv(numbers_srtd, file ="numbers_srtd.txt", sep = " ")
write.csv(words_srtd, file = "words_srtd.txt", sep =" ")

```
