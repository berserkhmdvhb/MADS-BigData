Problem_3:
-------------
This file gives explanations on the modifications of the SparkTwitterCollector
object.

The modifications are divided into three subtasks:

(1) Collect the hashtags from a one minute stream of tweets.

For this, we first defined our REGEX pattern as a broadcast variable.
(Pattern:"^#[A-Za-z0-9]* )

(2) Use the RDD transformations from the WordCount example 
to get the frequency of hashtags. 

As we create an RDD for each defined interval, we use the transformation
properties to each RDD to get an RDD of hashtags that match our desired pattern,
which in turn is further transformed to get the counts and sorted counts.

We will modify the interval and timeout to our needs when running the
script on the command line.

(3) Get the frequency of the hashtag pairs that co-occur within a tweet.

In order to extract those pairs, we need to pay attention to extract pairs
within ONE tweet, not from all the tweets.
We create RDDs which contain the hashtags with the desired pattern, and we
run a MapReduce job where we pair the hashtags with their count in the following format:

(#1:#2,count)

We will ony consider the top 1000 most frequent hashtag pairs.



The outputs are produced in the following way:
- raw tweets -> outputDirectory/tweets_TIMESTAMP
- just hashtags -> outputDirectory/hashtags_TIMESTAMP
- sorted hashtags -> outputDirectory/hashtags_sortedByCount_TIMESTAMP
- sorted pairs -> outputDirectory/hashtag_pairs_TIMESTAMP

In order to get a one-minute snapshot and have only 4 outputs (as indicated above),
please set the interval time to 60s and the timeout such that 60 <= timeout < 120.

From our test runs, one sees that hashtags give an impression of current trends, since
the most occurring hashtags are either related to politics or technologies such as
anything crypto and the associated NFTs. Moreover, it is interesting to see that no one pair
could be said to be truly common, indicating that the usage of hashtag pairs, at least
judging by a short 1 min snapshot, is highly individual; frequent individual hashtags
pertaining to the same subject do not necessarily lead to frequent pairs.

On a final note, judging by some other hashtags, people are kind of nasty...
